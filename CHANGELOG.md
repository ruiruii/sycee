# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `examples/near-anchor`: a NEAR testnet contract that anchors SYCEE receipt hashes. It stores hashes only. No scoring, no custody, no fund movement. Deployed as `sycee-anchor.testnet` from commit `01b4e419` (wasm 159146 bytes). The sample receipt is anchored at block 277456711. `npm run demo:e2e` runs a simulated payment and a local sandbox anchor. `npm run demo:security` shows a function-call key that cannot transfer NEAR. The public demo URL, demo video, and X post are still unset.

## 0.1.0

First release of the reference repository for SPEC v0.1.

- SPEC v0.1: agent spend semantics for consumption and redemption counts, and the Verifiable Spend Receipt (VSR) envelope.
- `@sycee/core`: canonical JSON, hashing, and Ed25519 `signVSR` / `verifyVSR`.
- Packages: `@sycee/middleware`, `@sycee/agent-sdk`, `@sycee/conformance`, `@sycee/adapter-automaton`, and `@sycee/probe`.
- Conformance vectors, the evidence-layer probe, and published reports.
